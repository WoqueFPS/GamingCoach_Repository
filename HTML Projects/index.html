<h2>VALORANT Patch Notes 9.09</h2>
<p>Bug fixes to various Agents, such as Gekko, Fade, and Deadlock, and more.</p>
<p>Hi folks! It's Ash, and I'm here to talk about Patch 9.09.</p>
<p>We fixed various bugs with Agents, such as Deadlock's ANNIHILATION sometimes getting stuck at ledges, players being able to outrun Fade’s Prowler, and now Gekko’s Thrash won’t have as much difficulty making some small jumps.</p>
<p>There's more to come with these year-end patches, so stay tuned!</p>
