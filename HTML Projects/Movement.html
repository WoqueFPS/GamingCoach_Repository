        <h1>How to Improve Your Movement in Valorant: A Personal Guide</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>Improving your movement in Valorant isn’t just about avoiding getting headshot instantly—it’s about making your gameplay smoother, more unpredictable, and easier to get kills. As someone who’s reached Radiant, I know that good movement can be just as important as precise aim. In this guide, I’ll walk you through the movement techniques I used to improve my game and help you master your movement, which can make you harder to hit and give you the upper hand in gunfights.</p>

        <h2>1. Avoid Holding W While Peeking</h2>
        <p>One of the most common mistakes players make is holding the W key when peeking angles. Holding W while peeking leaves you too exposed and makes it easy for enemies to track and kill you. Instead, focus on using the A and D keys to move left and right. This will help you move the fastest and make you a harder target to hit. You’ll have better control over your positioning and be able to react quicker to threats.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When you peek, use small, controlled movements, clearing one angle at a time. Avoid running into the open. It’s easier to clear angles without overexposing yourself if you focus on small, controlled movements.</p>

        <h2>2. To Counter-Strafe or Not to Counter-Strafe?</h2>
        <p>Counter strafing—pressing the opposite movement key (A or D) to stop your character instantly—can be useful, but in Valorant, it’s not as important as in other games like CS. In Valorant, the movement mechanics aren’t as fast, so counter strafing can be a bit of a nuance.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> While counter strafing isn't necessary for movement, you can use it to improve your accuracy while landing shots during movement. The difference is minimal, so don’t stress about it too much, but practicing it can help you land more accurate shots while moving.</p>

        <h2>3. Crouching: Use Sparingly</h2>
        <p>Crouching can be beneficial for recoil control, but it’s also a double-edged sword. When you crouch, you're committed to your position, which makes it easier for enemies to land headshots. I recommend avoiding crouching when you're fighting more than one enemy, against strafing enemies, or when holding an angle.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Only crouch when you're in a controlled, one-on-one fight or when you need to control your spray. Otherwise, try to stay standing and maintain your mobility.</p>

        <h2>4. Movement for Information Gathering</h2>
        <p>Good movement can also help you gather valuable intel for yourself and your team. It’s not just about getting around the map faster but about peeking angles without exposing yourself too much. The goal is to move in a way that gives you information while making you a harder target to hit.</p>

        <h3>Jiggle Peeking</h3>
        <p>This is a simple yet effective technique where you strafe in and out of cover quickly, revealing just a small part of your body. Doing this while using your knife can make you move faster and give you a quick look at any potential enemies without exposing yourself.</p>

        <h3>Jump Spotting</h3>
        <p>This is another technique that’s useful for gathering intel with minimal risk. Jump spots on certain maps like Ascent, Bind, and Icebox can give you valuable information, such as whether enemies are holding specific angles or pushing a site.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to practice jump spotting in custom games to get the timing and positioning down. This will give you a huge advantage in gathering info and can bait out shots from enemies trying to hit you.</p>

        <h2>5. Using Movement to Get Around the Map</h2>
        <p>To get around the map faster, practice bunny hopping and using movement tricks to gain an advantage. For example, on maps like Garage on Haven, you can use bunny hopping to quickly get up ramps, saving time while making you harder to hit. This will help you move through the map more fluidly and create opportunities to catch enemies off guard.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Bind your jump to the scroll wheel to make bunny hopping more consistent. The goal isn’t just to move faster, but to use your movement in a way that’s unpredictable and hard for enemies to track.</p>

        <h2>6. Mastering Jump Peeking</h2>
        <p>Jump peeking is a more advanced technique that allows you to gather information while minimizing risk. To jump peek, you need to run out, jump, and immediately pull yourself back with the opposite movement keys. This makes it hard for enemies to hit you while giving you the chance to spot them.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Jump peeking requires practice, but once mastered, it can make you very hard to hit while you gather intel. It’s especially useful when you’re holding a tight angle or pushing aggressively.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Consistency and Practice</h2>
        <p>Like anything in Valorant, improving your movement takes time and practice. Don’t expect instant results, but with consistent training, you’ll see significant improvements. Whether it’s mastering small peaks, improving your reaction time, or using movement to gather valuable intel, the more you practice, the better you’ll get.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Set aside time in custom games to practice your movement techniques. Whether it’s jump spotting, strafe peeking, or even bunny hopping, consistent practice will make these techniques second nature, improving both your survivability and effectiveness in gunfights.</p>
