                <h2>How to Improve Your Aim in Valorant: A Personal Guide</h2>
                <p>Improving your aim in Valorant can seem like a daunting task, especially if you’re stuck in the lower ranks. But trust me, as someone who started in Silver 2 and made it to Radiant, I can confidently say that with the right training and mindset, you can drastically improve your aim and overall gameplay.</p>
                <p>In this blog, I’m going to share my personal approach to aim training—no generic advice about crosshair placement here. Instead, I’ll walk you through the routine and strategies I used to improve my aim and help you hit more shots in Valorant.</p>

                <h3>1. Set Up Your Mouse Settings</h3>
                <p>Before you even start training, it's crucial to get your mouse settings dialed in. One of the first things I recommend is turning off “Enhanced Pointer Precision” in Windows. You can do this by searching for Mouse Settings on your PC, then going to “Additional Mouse Options,” and under “Pointer Options,” uncheck the box for “Enhanced Pointer Precision.”</p>
                <p>This setting enables mouse acceleration, which means your mouse movements will speed up based on how quickly you move it. If you want consistent aim and to build muscle memory, you need to turn this off. After doing this, you might find that your mouse feels faster, so it’s a good idea to adjust your DPI to a comfortable level.</p>

                <h3>2. Find Your Ideal Sensitivity</h3>
                <p>Sensitivity is another area that many players overlook. The wrong sensitivity can make it harder to track enemies and make small adjustments to your aim. To find the best sensitivity for you, I recommend turning on Aim Lab’s or Valorant’s practice range and tracking bots at both close and far ranges. Adjust your sensitivity in small increments until it feels comfortable.</p>
                <p>Don’t worry if you’re not hitting every shot right away—this is just to get a feel for the sensitivity you’re comfortable with. Once you find it, stick with it. Consistency is key.</p>

                <h3>3. Mechanical vs Passive Aim</h3>
                <p>Before we dive into the training routine, it’s important to understand the two types of aim: mechanical and passive.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mechanical Aim:</strong> This is what most people think of when they talk about aim. It’s your ability to move your crosshair precisely from one target to another. Mechanical aim improves with practice and muscle memory, and it’s something you can develop in any game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Passive Aim:</strong> This type of aim is more about game sense. In Valorant, passive aim usually refers to crosshair placement. It’s about positioning your crosshair where you expect enemies to be, so you don’t have to make large, rapid mouse movements to adjust your aim. With good passive aim, you’ll be able to land shots more easily and require less mechanical effort.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. The PREMS Method: My Aim Training Routine</h3>
                <p>Now, let's get to the good stuff—the routine that helped me improve my aim. I’ve developed something I like to call the <strong>PREMS method</strong>, which stands for <strong>Practice Bots, Recoil Control, Easy Bots, Medium Bots, and Strafe Movement</strong>. These are all exercises designed to train both mechanical and passive aim.</p>

                <h4>Practice Bots</h4>
                <p>This is the starting point. In the practice range, focus on keeping your crosshair at head level and avoiding vertical movement. You want to flick left and right smoothly, aiming for the middle of the head. The goal is to build muscle memory without overflicking or underflicking. Take it slow at first to develop good habits.</p>
                <p>I recommend practicing this for about 5 minutes—roughly the length of two songs. This will give you enough time to focus on precision without burning out.</p>

                <h4>Recoil Control</h4>
                <p>Spray control (recoil control) is an essential skill, but it’s something you should only rely on in specific situations. In the practice range, go to the recoil bots and practice spraying with rifles, like the Vandal, until your ammo runs out. This will help you control the spray and get used to long bursts, but don't focus on spraying too much during real matches—headshots should be your primary focus.</p>

                <h4>Easy Bots</h4>
                <p>This exercise might seem simple, but it's vital for building a strong foundation. The goal here is to practice one-tap headshots with precise, controlled movements. Use guns like the Sheriff or Guardian, which are accurate and require you to aim precisely. Don’t rush your shots—take your time and make sure each shot counts.</p>

                <h4>Medium Bots</h4>
                <p>Once you’re comfortable with easy bots, move on to the medium bots. Continue to focus on controlled shots and smooth aim, but now, challenge yourself with different ranges: close, medium, and far. This will help refine your aim and get it to feel more fluid.</p>

                <h4>Strafe Movement</h4>
                <p>In real games, you’ll be constantly moving while aiming. To simulate this, go to the side of the practice range (not the middle) and practice strafing with your A and D keys while tracking the bots. Stop momentarily before firing to make your shots more accurate. This helps you develop better tracking skills and prevents you from wasting shots while moving.</p>

                <h3>5. Additional Tips: Deathmatch and Crosshair Placement</h3>
                <p>Once you’ve warmed up with the PREMS method, I suggest jumping into a deathmatch game to practice crosshair placement and passive aim. Focus on positioning your crosshair at head level, and try to minimize your mouse movement. The less you have to adjust, the better.</p>
                <p>Also, make sure you’re practicing good movement habits. Practice jiggle peeking, which allows you to expose only a small part of your body, making it harder for enemies to land shots on you. I'll be making a movement guide soon to help with this, so stay tuned!</p>

                <h3>6. Conclusion: Consistency is Key</h3>
                <p>Improving your aim is all about consistency. The more you practice with the right techniques, the better you’ll get. Keep grinding, stay patient, and remember that the perfect practice will always yield better results than just putting in random hours of training. Aim is a skill that you can always improve, so don’t ever stop practicing.</p>
